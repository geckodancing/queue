Queue application

I've created a standard MVC style framework with a router to allow for expansion of the app.

Due to the time I've had to work on the app, I've kept it as simple as possible.  Additional functionality (not included in the spec) should include a delete button with a corresponding deleted flag in the database.

Additionally, I would like to have added some javascript validation the form data.

Ideally I would have liked to use separate tables for the type and service columns of the queue table as they are fixed options.
